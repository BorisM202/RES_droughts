%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
Increasing the share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES), combined with RES dependence on weather, poses a critical challenge for energy systems. This study investigates the importance of the balance between wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend photovoltaic (PV) capacity on periods of low renewable generation, known as RES droughts. Three different RES \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend are used to estimate the capacity factors for different scenarios of installed capacities for wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV power. The skill of the RES \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend is quantified by comparing capacity factor time series to observed hourly data and by assessing their representation of observed RES droughts. The RES \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend are used to generate a 45-year hourly time series of RES capacity factor, enabling analysis of the frequency, duration and return periods of RES droughts at a climatological scale. Results show the importance of using an accurate, validated RES \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dataset }\DIFaddend for RES drought risk assessment. The addition of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity to a wind-dominated system results in a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of RES droughts, while also reducing extremes and seasonal \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought patterns. These findings underscore the importance of diversification in RES capacity to enhance energy security and resilience.

\section{Introduction}

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:intro}
\DIFaddend 

The EU aims to generate at least 69\% of its electricity from renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030, up from 41\% in 2022\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \citep{eurostat2023share}. While this transition is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it also highlights the challenge of managing the variability of weather-dependent energy sources such as wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend photovoltaic (PV) power. This challenge is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compounded }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{amplified }\DIFaddend by the increasing electrification of energy sectors, which places greater demand on the power system and makes it more sensitive to meteorological conditions~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bloomfield2016, bloomfield2021, vanderwiel2019drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{staffell2018demand}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Periods of low renewable generation, known as \textit{Dunkelflaute} or RES droughts, pose significant risks to system adequacy and energy security, emphasising the need for a resilient energy system to meet both growing electricity demand and decarbonisation targets.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This study focuses on Ireland, a region with a strong reliance on wind power, which has ambitious targets for PV power expansion. This case study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of diversifying the renewable energy mix on RES droughts. The performance of different RES models are compared, and a 45-year time series of RES generation is produced. The results highlight the role of increased PV capacity in reducing RES drought risks, offering insights for policymakers and energy planners. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{For this study, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES drought events do not have a fixed definition, with various approaches present in the literature. One common method defines }\DIFaddend a RES drought \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{event is defined as occurring when }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as a period during which }\DIFaddend the average capacity factor (CF) remains below a fixed threshold for a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{given duration, following the methodology used in other research~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kaspar2019drought, ohba2022drought, mockert2023drought, mayer2023drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Alternative methods exist for defining }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{specified duration. For example, Kaspar et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kaspar2019drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
used this method to investigate the shortfall risks of low wind and solar PV generation in Europe, with a focus on Germany, testing multiple CF thresholds and durations. Similarly, Mockert et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{mockert2023drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
examined the link between weather regimes and RES droughts in Germany using a 48-hour rolling window under a threshold to define }\DIFaddend RES droughts. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{One approach uses relative CF thresholds that change }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Similar fixed-threshold approaches have also been applied using CF series reconstructed through machine learning in regions such as Japan~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ohba2022drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
and Hungary~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{mayer2023drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{Alternative methods adjust the CF threshold dynamically }\DIFaddend over the year to account for seasonal variations in renewable \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{energy generation ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{raynaud2018drought, rinaldi2021drought, gangopadhyay2022drought, allen2023drought, kapica2024drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Another common method relies on percentile-based thresholds, where drought eventsare defined by identifying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{production. Raynaud et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{raynaud2018drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
defined RES droughts as sequences of days with renewable electricity generation below a threshold that varies seasonally, a methodology later adapted for India~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{gangopadhyay2022drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Building on this, Kapica et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kapica2024drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
compared the likelihood of increased RES droughts in Europe under different climate models. Other studies have defined RES droughts based on deviations from daily mean production: Rinaldi et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{rinaldi2021drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
applied these in the U.S. Western Interconnection to quantify the benefits of long-term storage, while Brown et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{brown2021drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
examined weekly timescales to explore meteorological influences on the most severe RES drought events. Another method defines RES drought indices based on metrics commonly used in hydro-meteorology to characterise RES droughts~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{allen2023drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. This approach identifies }\DIFaddend periods of unusually low generation relative to historical production levels, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{typically based on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using }\DIFaddend the lowest production percentiles\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{allen2023drought, bracken2024drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.Additionally, some studies combine these definitions with metrics that incorporate the demand side of energy consumption, analysing the balance between supply and demand during drought periods~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{raynaud2018drought, rinaldi2021drought, allen2023drought, bracken2024drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Bracken at al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bracken2024drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
used this approach to analyse RES droughts at different time scales in the U.S.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bracken2024drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, and Lei et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{lei2024drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
used it to quantify RES droughts in wind-PV-hydro systems in China.
}

\DIFadd{In addition to examining periods of low renewable electricity generation, several studies also explore the periods when the imbalance between renewable generation and electricity demand (residual demand) is high. Raynaud et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{raynaud2018drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
showed the difference between RES droughts and high residual demand events in a hypothetical fully renewable system composed of wind, solar PV and run-of-the-river hydropower. Similarly, Allen and Otero~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{allen2023drought} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
also defined a standardised index based on meteorological droughts to address residual demand, whose correlation to the electricity generation index is mostly negative (as expected, although quite low anticorrelations and even small positive correlations appear for some European countries). This index was also applied to the U.S. by Bracken et al.~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bracken2024drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, revealing a consistent increase in the RES drought magnitude when demand is considered, despite showing differing results across regions.
}

\DIFaddend In this paper, the focus is exclusively on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{energy generation, and a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{renewable electricity generation, to keep the focus on RES droughts driven by the weather. A }\DIFaddend fixed threshold approach \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is used }\DIFaddend to define RES droughts\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is used}\DIFdelend , which facilitates consistent inter-comparison between scenarios with different installed wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacities.  \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The case study used in this paper is Ireland, a region where most RES generation comes from wind power and with ambitious targets for solar PV power expansion. This provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of adding solar PV installations in wind-dominated countries.
}\DIFaddend 

RES droughts are identified using onshore wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV CF time series. In this study, three different datasets are used \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and compared}\DIFaddend , all of which are driven by \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend ERA5 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reanalysis}\DIFaddend ~\citep{hersbach2020era5}. Two of the datasets are part of C3S Energy (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3SE}\DIFaddend ), an energy-based operational dataset produced by the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{dubus2023energy, cds2023energy}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{dubus2023energy}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . One of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3SE }\DIFaddend datasets provides CF time series aggregated at the national scale, while the other provides the CF time series at each grid point, at the ERA5 resolution of 0.25¬∞. The third dataset \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{produced by the authors }\DIFaddend was generated using the Atlite model~\citep{hofman2021atlite}, which converts the ERA5 atmospheric data to a generation time series using specified wind turbine and PV panel models. Atlite is an open-source tool developed by PyPSA~\citep{hofman2021atlite} and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is widely }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{has been }\DIFaddend used for estimating wind and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PV generation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{mockert2023drought, li2023atlite, parzen2023atlite, ali2023comparative}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV generation in order to study RES droughts in Germany~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{mockert2023drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{Generic datasets for wind and solar PV CF are often used for the quantification of RES droughts. Despite undergoing a general validation process, they are often not fully representative of each geographical location, and can show differences in the number of RES drought events subsequently identified~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kies2021drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. This study evaluates the skill of a dataset developed for the European region (C3SE) when applied to a specific country; Ireland, representative of Northwestern Europe. In particular, the analysis explores the impact of using a generic versus a tailored dataset on RES drought assessments, in the context of a transition from a wind-dominated system to one with a greater share of solar PV capacity}\DIFaddend .

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aim of this study is to answer two questions which are relevant for systems with a large share of RES generation:
}\begin{itemize}
	\item \DIFadd{Do generic datasets have sufficient skill to reliably quantify RES drought events?
	}\item \DIFadd{How does the integration of solar PV generation into a predominantly wind-based system alter the characteristics of RES drought events?
}\end{itemize}

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend datasets used in this study are detailed in section~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:Data}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:data}}\DIFaddend , which describes their characteristics and relevance for evaluating RES droughts. Section~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:Methods} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:methods} }\DIFaddend outlines the RES \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend used to simulate wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV generation and provides the methodology for defining and identifying RES drought events, including the thresholds and metrics applied. In section~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:Results}, the models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:results}, the datasets }\DIFaddend are first verified against observed energy data to assess their accuracy, followed by an analysis of RES drought occurrences for two scenarios with different ratios of installed wind to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacities. Finally, section~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{sec:Conclusion} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{sec:conclusions} }\DIFaddend offers a discussion of the results in the context of energy reliability and future planning, followed by the main conclusions and recommendations for further research.

\section{Data}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \label{sec:Data}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:data}
\DIFaddend 

This study uses publicly available datasets to construct and validate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend for estimating the CF of wind and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PV energy}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV power}\DIFaddend . The primary data sources include: EirGrid and SONI, the transmission system operators (TSO) for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, respectively; the ERA5 reanalysis dataset; and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E datasets}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3SE dataset}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV Capacity and Availability}
\label{sec:eirgrid}

EirGrid, the TSO for the Republic of Ireland, and SONI, the Northern Ireland TSO, provide detailed datasets on all wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV farms across the island of Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) from 1990 to the present~\citep{eirgrid2023spreadsheet}. These datasets include information such as each farm‚Äôs installed capacity, name, and connection date. To enhance the accuracy of this data, the longitude and latitude for each farm were manually determined through online searches. For simplicity, this data will be referred to as originating from EirGrid, as all-island data was directly obtained from EirGrid, and the combined regions of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will be referred to as Ireland throughout the remainder of this document.

The spreadsheet available from the EirGrid website contains two key variables: generation and availability. Generation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and availability values are available from 2014 onward for wind power and from 2018 onward for solar PV power, although solar PV availability data only became present in the Republic of Ireland in 2023. Generation }\DIFaddend is the energy that a RES farm actually contributed to the grid, which may include limitations introduced by the TSO to maintain grid stability, such as constraints and curtailment. Availability represents the energy that would have been generated from a RES farm if no grid constraints had been applied, making it representative of the weather-related response. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Generation and availability values are available from 2014 onward for wind power and from 2018 onward for PV power, although PV availability data only became present in the Republic of Ireland in 2023. }\DIFdelend This study focuses on availability for all analyses.

\subsection{Atmospheric Variables}
\label{sec:era5}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite and C3S-E datasets }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{All of the datasets used in this study }\DIFaddend are driven by \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data from }\DIFaddend the ERA5 reanalysis~\citep{hersbach2020era5}, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This global gridded dataset provides hourly atmospheric variables from 1940 to the present at a horizontal resolution of 0.25\textdegree. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It is widely used for estimating PV and wind energy~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{mockert2023drought, dubus2023energy, brown2021drought, otero2022drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend Table~\ref{tab:var_name} lists the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relevant }\DIFaddend ERA5 variables\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{used by Atlite and C3S-Energy}\DIFdelend .

\subsection{C3S Energy}
\label{sec:c3se}

The EU Copernicus Climate Change Service developed the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S-Energy (C3SE) }\DIFaddend renewable energy dataset for Europe~\citep{dubus2023energy}, using ERA5 atmospheric variables and weather-to-energy models. This dataset provides hourly CF for wind and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PV energy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV power }\DIFaddend from 1979 to the present. The data are available on the same grid as the ERA5 data, which has a horizontal resolution of 0.25¬∞. The time series are also available for download at two aggregated scales: regional (NUTS 2) and national.

The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E dataset estimates wind energy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wind CF in C3SE was calculated }\DIFaddend using wind speeds at 100 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{metres }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m }\DIFaddend ($u_{100}$, $v_{100}$) and a standard \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wind }\DIFaddend turbine model, the Vestas V136/3450, with a fixed hub height of 100 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{meters. This choice is based on expert advice and the trend in wind turbine installation. The PV generation model used by C3S-E uses two }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m. As data on wind turbine fleet locations and specifications are difficult to obtain across Europe, C3SE assumes a homogeneous distribution of wind turbines across the }\DIFaddend ERA5 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variables: }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{grid. While this approach does not capture the precise capacity factors reported by grid operators, it provides a well-correlated time series that effectively represents the impact of weather variability on wind power generation. The C3SE solar PV CF was also calculated for the ERA5 grid. It is derived from meteorological data, including }\DIFaddend surface solar radiation downwards ($ssrd$) and air temperature ($t2m$)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. PV generation is calculated multiple times, using the same modelwith different azimuth and tilt angles. The results are aggregated based on a statistical distribution of the module angles based on the geographical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, using a reference solar PV plant model.  This model incorporates empirical calculations for key system components, such as optical losses, the electrical characteristics of the power module and the power curve of the PV inverter. The final CF accounts for a mix of module orientations typical for each }\DIFaddend location~\citep{saintdrenan2018solar}.

This study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{uses three datasets to analyse RES droughts across the island of Ireland.

The third dataset was computed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~GRD), and a third dataset derived }\DIFaddend using the Atlite model (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL}\DIFaddend ).

The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gridded dataset from C3S-E was used to create CF datasets which account for the location of RES farms in Ireland. A list }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~GRD dataset uses, as inputs, the actual locations }\DIFaddend of the RES farms in Ireland\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was compiled, including each farm‚Äôs latitude, longitude and installed capacity.

\subsection{Energy Scenarios}
\label{sec:scenarios}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The three datasets provide time series for both wind and solar PV CF. }\DIFaddend In addition to analysing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wind and PV generation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the CF of wind and solar PV }\DIFaddend separately, a combined CF was computed for each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dataset }\DIFaddend by averaging wind and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PV generation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV CF}\DIFaddend , weighted by their installed capacities at the end of 2023 (5.9 GW for wind power and 0.6 GW for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV power). This configuration is referred to as the 91W-9PV scenario, reflecting the distribution of 91\% wind and 9\% \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity. Given that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity in Ireland is low in 2023, and to explore how a more balanced distribution of wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacities might impact RES droughts, this study also considered a second scenario, referred to as 57W-43PV, where the installed \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity is assumed to increase to 8.6 GW, while wind capacity rises to 11.45 GW. These values are based on targets outlined in the roadmap published by the 2024 Climate Action Plan~\citep{cap2024future}. This study does not include offshore wind in the analysis. Recent reports suggest that even by 2030, Ireland is unlikely to have any significant new offshore wind farms, with projected offshore capacity expected to remain near zero using realistic scenarios~\citep{seai2024future}.

New time series were generated for both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite and C3S-E G PV models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL and C3S~GRD solar PV datasets}\DIFaddend , incorporating a revised distribution of installed capacity across Ireland as specified in the roadmap\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{eirgrid2023future}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . For wind power, the CF time series remains unchanged, as significant shifts in the location of wind farms are not expected. In total, twelve CF time series were analysed in this study, six for individual wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV CF (three \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets }\DIFaddend for each source) in the 91W-9PV scenario, and an additional six time series that include the combined CF for 91W-9PV and 57W-43PV scenarios across the different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{datasets}\DIFaddend .

It is important to note that the specific capacity values used in this study are illustrative and are not intended to reflect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{precise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accurate }\DIFaddend future realities. Instead, they serve to explore the impact of transitioning from a wind-dominated system (91W-9PV) to a more evenly distributed system (57W-43PV). This approach allows for a comparative analysis between the two scenarios, assessing how the balance of RES capacity affects the occurrence of RES droughts.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In summary, for each of the three datasets (ATL, C3S GRD and C3S NAT) four energy scenarios are examined:
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \DIFadd{Wind Power - based on actual capacity at the end of 2023
	}\item \DIFadd{Solar PV Power - based on actual capacity at the end of 2023
	}\item \DIFadd{Combined RES / 91W-9PV - based on actual capacity at the end of 2023
	}\item \DIFadd{Combined RES / 57W-43PV - based on projected capacity for 2030
}\end{itemize}

\DIFaddend \subsection{RES Drought Definition}
\label{sec:res_drought}

In this study, a RES drought event was defined as occurring when the 24-hour moving average of CF remains below a fixed threshold of 0.1 for a period of longer than 24 hours. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The choice of this threshold is somewhat arbitrary, but aligns with similar studies on low renewable energy production \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kaspar2019drought, ohba2022drought, mayer2023drought}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend By using a 24-hour moving average, fewer but longer-lasting events were captured compared to using the raw CF time series, which can be more sensitive to short-term fluctuations. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The 24-hour rolling average also avoids potential masking of day-long events due to their start time. }\DIFaddend A fixed threshold approach was chosen in this study to enable consistent inter-comparison between datasets.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{droughts_methodology.pdf}
	\caption{Wind time series of CF (green) and its 24-hour moving average (pink) from the 7th to the 15th of July 2021. The black dashed line indicates the CF threshold. The grey bar shows the period identified as a wind drought under our definition}
	\label{fig:find_res_droughts}
\end{figure}

The moving average approach smooths out short-term fluctuations, so that brief periods above the threshold do not interrupt an otherwise continuous low-CF period (Fig.~\ref{fig:find_res_droughts}). This means that a single hour above the threshold does not "break" a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought event if it is surrounded by prolonged low-generation hours. As a result, fewer but longer-lasting \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought events are identified, which may better reflect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{real-world }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{actual }\DIFaddend conditions where energy supply constraints persist over extended periods.

\subsection{Verification}
\label{sec:verification}

The accuracy of the datasets used in this study was verified \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{against national generation data}\DIFaddend , before continuing to the analysis of RES droughts. For the verification process, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time-varying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{time varying }\DIFaddend values of installed capacity were used to account for changes in RES development over the verification period. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{step allowed us to assess }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{validation step evaluates }\DIFaddend how well the datasets represent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the production of renewable energy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{actual renewable generation profiles }\DIFaddend by comparing them against observed data. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The overall statistical distribution of CF values for wind (2014‚Äì2023) and solar PV (2023) is presented in the violin plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:violin_plots}. These plots illustrate the density of CF values for each dataset, highlighting their differences and alignment with observations. The results indicate that ATL aligns more closely with observations for wind, while all datasets exhibit similar distributions for solar PV.

\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Wind Energy}
\label{sec:wind_verification}

The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets use the Vestas V136/3450 wind turbine power curve \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend (Fig.~\ref{fig:power_curve}a). The Atlite model allows the user to specify the power curve. We considered the 121 power curves available for download from Renewables.ninja~\citep{staffell2016wake}. For each power curve, Renewables.ninja also provides four associated smoothed power curves. The smoothing is done using a Gaussian filter with different standard deviations that depend on the wind speed. A separate wind CF time series for Ireland was generated for each of the wind turbine power curves and smoothing levels.

The performance of each CF time series is then assessed based on four skill scores: correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and the percentage of overlap. The percentage of overlap quantifies the similarity between the observed and modelled distributions. It is a positively oriented skill score, where 100\% shows full agreement between the two distributions, and 0\% indicates no overlap. The histograms of hourly CF values for the most recent decade (2014-2023) are used to calculate this skill score.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{verification_power_curve.pdf}
	\caption{a) Power curves of the Enercon E112.4500 with a 0.3w smoothing filter used by \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{Atlite }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{the ATL dataset }\DIFaddendFL (orange) and the Vestas V136/3450 used by \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{C3S-E }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{the two C3S datasets }\DIFaddendFL (blue) b) Histograms of wind CF for Ireland \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{from Atlite }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{for the ATL dataset }\DIFaddendFL (orange), \DIFdelbeginFL \DIFdelFL{C3S-E }\DIFdelendFL \DIFaddbeginFL \DIFaddFL{the C3S datasets }\DIFaddendFL (blue) and Observed (shaded)}
	\label{fig:power_curve}
\end{figure}

Based on these metrics, the most representative power curve for Ireland is the Enercon E112.4500 power curve with the $0.3w$ smoothing filter. The smoothing of the wind turbine power curve represents losses associated with each turbine, as well as losses such as wake effects between turbines, which are important when modelling wind energy on larger spatial scales. The histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:power_curve}b shows that the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3SE }\DIFaddend power curve tends to underestimate low CF values and overestimate higher ones, whereas the smoothed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend power curve more closely follows the observed wind availability data. This is further supported by the percentage of overlap which is higher for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend (97.2\%) than for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3SE }\DIFaddend (83.2\%), indicating better agreement with observed data.

The effect of the difference between the power curves is also visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:wind_verification_contour}, which shows a density plot of wind CF values. The two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets are shown to overestimate the observed CF, whereas the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL dataset }\DIFaddend is in good agreement with the observed data. The skill scores presented in Table~\ref{tab:wind_skill_scores} show that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend performs better than the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two C3S }\DIFaddend datasets for all of the skill scores.

The figure reveals that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend presents the best overall agreement with the observed frequency and duration of wind drought events.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Verification of wind generation data highlights the importance of selecting a representative wind turbine power curve for the region being analysed. The ATL dataset, which uses a representative wind turbine power curve, is skilled at reproducing wind CF and RES droughts across Ireland. On the other hand, the power curve used for both C3S~GRD and C3S~NAT is not representative for Ireland, as it severely overestimates generation, underestimating the occurrence of RES droughts. This highlights a problem with using generalised datasets for analysing RES droughts: biases severely affect their ability to accurately reproduce RES drought events. The skill scores for the three datasets (Table~\ref{tab:wind_skill_scores}) show only a small difference in their ability to reproduce the changes in CF, as seen by their similar CC scores. However, their ability to reproduce the actual CF values is much lower than that for ATL, with RMSE scores almost four times higher than for the two C3S datasets. There is a clear bias towards an overestimation of CF, seen in the MBE values, which leads to an underestimation of RES droughts, which highlights the strong motivation to use regionally verified models to assess RES droughts.

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Solar }\DIFaddend PV Energy}
\label{sec:pv_verification}

The Atlite model allows the user to select certain PV panel characteristics. In this study, the three PV panel types available in the Atlite model were considered (CSi, CdTe, Kaneka). Following the same methodology as in the previous section, the three available models were compared using four skill scores (CC, RMSE, MBE, and the percentage of overlap). Based on the best-performing metrics, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Breyer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Beyer }\DIFaddend PV panel model was selected\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \citep{beyer2004pv}, using the Kaneka Hybrid panel option. For all \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV farm locations, the azimuth angle is fixed at 180\textdegree (due south), and the optimal tilt angle option is applied. 

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV installed capacity available on the spreadsheets from EirGrid represents the Maximum Export Capacity (MEC) and does not accurately reflect the installed \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity. To enable actual \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV generation potential to be modelled correctly, installed capacities were set at 1.4 times the MEC values. This scaling factor was estimated by analysing proprietary data from individual \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV farms provided by EirGrid, which showed that, on average, assuming that the installed capacities of farms exceed their MEC values by 40\% yields the best agreement with the observed availability.

Fig.~\ref{fig:bar_number_events_verification_pv} shows the number of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV drought events during the 2023 validation period across different duration ranges.

In this section, RES \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{droughts are analysed by calculating the frequency and duration of events, their return periods, and their seasonality. By examining both the frequency of occurrence and duration of these events, TSOs can better assess the need for alternative fossil fuel-based generation, long-duration energy storage, demand-side measures, and enhanced interconnections with neighbouring power systems to ensure adequate supply in a cost-effective manner. Results are presented for the three datasets, which clearly illustrate how different modelling assumptions influence the characterisation of RES droughts.
}

\DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought events are evaluated under two different scenarios with fixed installed capacities: the 91W-9PV scenario, with 5.9 GW of wind capacity and 0.6 GW of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity; and the 57W-43PV scenario, where wind capacity comprises 11.45 GW and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV capacity increases to 8.6 GW. Both scenarios were driven by 45 years of ERA5 data. Using the RES drought identification process described in Section~\ref{sec:res_drought}, wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV droughts are first analysed separately before presenting the results for combined (wind + \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV) RES droughts under both scenarios.

\subsubsection{Annual Number of RES Droughts}

The first part of the analysis examines the annual number of RES drought events\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{across the three datasets}\DIFdelend . When only wind energy is considered (Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot_number_events}a), the number of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES drought }\DIFaddend events decreases as the duration range increases, with very few events lasting more than seven days. In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the case of only }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contrast, for solar }\DIFaddend PV energy (Fig.~\ref{fig:boxplot_number_events}b), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the number of events also declines as the duration range extends }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES drought frequency declines }\DIFaddend from one to eight days \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, followed by a slight increase }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and then slightly increases }\DIFaddend for longer durations.

\subsubsection{Return Periods of RES Drought Duration}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend RES drought events identified over the 45-year period were used to calculate the return periods for different RES drought durations. A return period is the estimated average time interval between events of a specified duration \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or intensity }\DIFdelend (not to be confused with the frequency of their occurrence within a fixed time frame). Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{illustrates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shows }\DIFaddend the return periods for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{varying }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{different }\DIFaddend RES drought durations, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{highlighting how often different drought lengths are likely to occur across the datasets. This analysis provides insight into the frequency and likelihood of prolonged low-generation periods , which is crucial for evaluating the potential impact of RES droughts on energy reliability and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which can be used to capture the most extreme events affecting the system. Understanding their return periods is crucial to inform decision makers about the trade-off between the risk of extreme events and the associated costs of mitigation measures. Extreme but rare RES droughts pose the toughest challenge to energy security by placing significant strain on the conventional backup sources necessary to maintain }\DIFaddend security of supply \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during these events}\DIFaddend .

The duration of wind droughts (Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}a) increases in a log-linear fashion across the three datasets. The log-linear trend indicates a predictable relationship between \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wind }\DIFaddend drought duration and occurrence, with longer wind droughts becoming exponentially less likely as duration increases. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend In the case of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV droughts (Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}b), Atlite behaves differently than the two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite results }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL dataset }\DIFaddend show a generally log-linear increase. For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E G and C3S-E N}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~GRD and C3S~NAT}\DIFaddend , the duration of PV droughts increases in a log-linear pattern for events lasting less than 16 days. Beyond this duration, there is a sharp rise in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV }\DIFaddend drought duration for events up to a one-year return period. This sudden increase again reflects the impact of extended periods of low PV generation during winter in Ireland. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The difference between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite and the C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the ATL and the C3S }\DIFaddend results arises from differences in the datasets near the threshold of 0.1 CF. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend remains slightly above the threshold more frequently during these conditions, leading to shorter, more fragmented \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought events. In contrast, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E G and C3S-E N }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~GRD and C3S~NAT }\DIFaddend tend to fall below the threshold in similar conditions, resulting in longer continuous \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought periods, especially during winter.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Under }\DIFaddend the 91W-9PV scenario (Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}c), the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{combined RES drought }\DIFaddend return periods mirror those \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}a, due to the low levels of installed PV capacity. In }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for wind alone, reflecting the dominance of wind in the current energy mix. In contrast, }\DIFaddend the 57W-43PV scenario (Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}d) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, the return periods for RES droughts increase across all durations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shows a dramatic reduction in RES drought durations, suggesting that a more balanced share of wind and solar PV capacity can substantially mitigate the frequency of prolonged RES drought events}\DIFaddend . For example, the return period for a five-day \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought event (shown by the vertical dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extends }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increases }\DIFaddend from roughly six months for the 91W-9PV scenario, to four years for the 57W-43PV scenario \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the ATL }\DIFaddend dataset, and from about fifteen months to around five years \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the two C3S-E datasets. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the two C3S datasets. This result indicates that the complementarity between wind and solar PV plays a crucial role in reducing the occurrence of RES drought events in a diversified energy portfolio.

\end{figure}

Across Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}a, c, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend d, the return periods in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend dataset are consistently higher than those in the two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets. For instance, in the 91W-9PV scenario (Fig.~\ref{fig:return_periods}c), an event with a one-year return period lasts six days in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL }\DIFaddend dataset, compared to only five days in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets. This difference underscores the importance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dataset }\DIFaddend selection when quantifying RES droughts, as each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{dataset}\DIFaddend ‚Äôs assumptions and parametrisations significantly influence \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought duration estimates. Additionally, in all four graphs, the similarity between results from the two \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S }\DIFaddend datasets suggests that assumptions in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite model‚Äî}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL dataset, }\DIFaddend such as wind turbine power curve selection and PV panel specifications\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{‚Äî}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend have a greater impact on RES drought duration estimates than the precise geographic distribution of RES farms when studying the return periods of RES droughts.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The return periods calculated from the three datasets show large differences, in particular for the more extreme events with longer return periods. The C3S datasets produce shorter RES drought durations for these events, which would have the largest impact on the power system. This shows that system planning based on the wrong datasets could yield an underestimation of the duration of extreme RES droughts, potentially leading to shortages linked to undersized reserve capacity.

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Seasonal Distribution of RES Droughts}

The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seasonality }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seasonal analysis }\DIFaddend of RES droughts \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was analysed by comparing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is based on }\DIFaddend the percentage of hours in each month classified as part of a RES drought \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{event. Wind droughts tend to be more frequent during summer, whereas solar PV droughts are more common in winter due to reduced sunlight. By comparing these seasonal patterns across different datasets and energy scenarios, this study examines how differences in model assumptions and capacity mix influence the characterisation of RES drought events. In Northwestern Europe, winter droughts are primarily driven by variations in wind generation, whereas summer droughts are mainly related to solar generation. This seasonal analysis is critical to ensure a cost-effective balance between generation and demand throughout the year}\DIFaddend .

For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wind-dominated scenarios }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the wind-only scenario }\DIFaddend (Fig.~\ref{fig:res_droughts_seasonality}a\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~\&~c}\DIFdelend ), the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{percentage of hours that are part of a drought is higher in summer than in winter. In the Atlite dataset , for instance, an average of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL dataset exhibits a pronounced seasonal pattern, with about }\DIFaddend 24\% of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hours in summer (June-July-August) are identified as wind droughts , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{summer hours (June, July, August) identified as RES droughts }\DIFaddend compared to only 4\% in winter (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{December-January-February}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{December, January, February}\DIFaddend ). This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seasonal variation is less prominent for the two C3S-E datasetscompared to the Atlite one. This difference can be linked to the shape of the two power curves (Fig.~\ref{fig:power_curve}). CFs near or under }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{strong seasonal signal is less evident in the C3S datasets, which suggests that the differences in the underlying wind power curves play a significant role. In ATL, CF near or below }\DIFaddend the 0.1 threshold \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{occur at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{occurs at relatively }\DIFaddend higher wind speeds\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for the Atlite power curve than for the C3S-E one}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, resulting in a higher count of RES drought hours during the summer months}\DIFaddend . In contrast, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the results for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV droughts (Fig.~\ref{fig:res_droughts_seasonality}b) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show a higher percentage in winter, with PV droughts occurring }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{display an opposite seasonal trend.

The 91W-9PV scenario (Fig.~\ref{fig:res_droughts_seasonality}c) shows patterns \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{comparable }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{similar }\DIFaddend to the ones for wind droughts (Fig.~\ref{fig:res_droughts_seasonality}a). However, in the 91W/9PV scenario, the number of hours classified as RES droughts in summer decreases slightly compared to the wind-only scenario. This reduction can be explained by the contribution of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV generation during the summer months in the 91W-9PV scenario, even though it constitutes only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{11}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{9}\DIFaddend \% of total capacity. Since the number of RES drought hours for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV in summer is near zero, this small contribution has a noticeable impact on reducing overall \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RES }\DIFaddend drought hours. In the 57W-43PV scenario (Fig.~\ref{fig:res_droughts_seasonality}d), all three datasets show a reduction in monthly RES drought frequency. Annual reductions in median RES drought frequency are observed across the datasets, dropping from 14\% to 5\% for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ATL}\DIFaddend , from 8\% to 3\% for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E G}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~GRD}\DIFaddend , and from 9\% to 4\% for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{C3S-E N}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{C3S~NAT}\DIFaddend . The balanced mix of wind and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar }\DIFaddend PV power in this scenario reduces the seasonal signal overall and significantly decreases the percentage of RES drought hours in the summer.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This study has investigated the ability of three RES models to represent RES droughts : Atlite, C3S-E G, and C3S-E N. One of the most evident differences is how each dataset incorporates the specific locations of RES farms. Both Atlite and C3S-E G consider the locations of wind and PV farms, which one would expect to result in a more accurate representation of RES generation. While this approach slightly improves PV models, our analysis indicates that for wind energy , the Atlite dataset performs better overall, especially in its close alignment with observed data for wind generation estimates.

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{droughts critical for the sizing of reserve capacity. Our results show that selecting the wrong dataset could severely underestimate RES droughts during winter months, thereby affecting the reliability of the energy system during critical periods. Additionally, the integration of large shares of solar PV in the system leads to a generalised reduction of RES droughts, yet winter months present a slight increase. The natural limitations of solar PV lead to inevitably higher reserve capacity needs during winter months as reliance on RES increases. These types of insights are essential to develop targeted strategies that enhance grid resilience and ensure a stable energy supply throughout the year.
}\DIFaddend 


\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Atlite shows the best alignment with observed data for wind generation. Differences between the models are smaller for PV, with C3S-G performing marginally better than the other two.
The results show that the two C3S-E datasets (C3S-E G and C3S-E N) consistently yield similar outcomes, indicating that their methodological differences have minimal impact in this case. This distinction is also evident in the analysis, where Atlite reports higher return periods and a greater number of RES droughts, especially in scenarios with a balanced share of RES . Again, the results from RES drought modelling rely more on the precision of the wind power curve and PV panel modelsthan on the specific locations of RES farms. Atlite‚Äôs superior performance highlights the importance of selecting validated models for assessing RES drought risks. This careful model selection can better quantify risks, support effective planning , and avoid the potential underestimation of capacity needs, which is essential for ensuring energy security.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{\DIFadd{Conclusions}}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\DIFadd{This study aimed to answer two key questions: Do generic datasets have sufficient skill to reliably quantify RES drought events? How does the integration of solar PV into a predominantly wind-based system alter the characteristics of RES droughts? To address these questions, three datasets were compared: two derived from the European C3S-Energy dataset, and one developed by the authors. The datasets derived from C3S-Energy differ in their assumptions, one assumes a homogeneous distribution of wind and solar PV capacity across the region, while the other includes the actual locations of RES farms. The dataset developed by the authors uses a regionally validated model which accounts for farm locations and uses tailored wind and solar PV models selected to represent the actual generation.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Looking at the 57W-43PV scenario, the analysis showed a significant improvement in the management }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our results demonstrate that datasets without regional validation misrepresent the frequency and duration of RES drought events due to their limited ability to reproduce the observations. The inclusion of wind and solar PV farm locations has limited impact on RES drought analysis compared to the choice of wind turbine power curves and solar PV models. Whereas all three datasets capture broad trends in the duration and seasonality of RES drought events, the actual number of events is consistently underestimated by the non-validated datasets. This effect becomes clearer for extreme events, as not using regionally validated datasets can yield an overestimation of the return periods of RES droughts. This can lead to insufficient reserve capacity planning and potential risks to grid stability and security of supply.
}

\DIFadd{The effect of adding solar PV capacity to a wind dominated power system, as is currently happening in Northwestern Europe, has been explored in the context }\DIFaddend of RES droughts\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due to the complementary nature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Our analysis has demonstrated that transitioning to a system with more equal amounts }\DIFaddend of wind and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PV generation. Wind and PV together perform better in terms of reducing drought frequency and duration than either would individually, largely because of the seasonal anti-correlation between the two energy sources. This diversification reduces the seasonal impact on RES droughts, as PV generation peaks in the summer and wind generation is more consistent in winter. Ireland currently has a highly wind-dependent energy system, but with ambitious targets for PV installations in the coming years, the energy mix is expected to approach a balance between wind and PV capacity.
While this balanced approach offers a more stable and secure energy supply by mitigating RES drought risks, it is important to note that having similar wind and PV capacities may not optimise other aspects, such as annual energy production or meeting nighttime loads. For policymakers, these findings underscore the importance of meeting these capacity targets to enhance energy security through diversification. Additionally, the choice of model for RES drought assessment becomes increasingly critical as more renewable capacity is integrated into the system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{solar PV capacity reduces the occurrence of RES drought events, mitigates extreme RES drought conditions and enhances overall system resilience. This improvement is attributed to the complementary nature of wind and solar PV generation, as solar PV generation typically peaks in summer while wind generation predominates during winter. However, this integration is unable to counter critical winter RES droughts, which coincide with the strongest electricity demand in Northern European countries.
}

\DIFadd{The results presented in this study have three main limitations. First, the definition of RES droughts based on generation does not consider the important role of demand, which could be of interest to system operators. Second, recent solar PV capacity expansions have changed the generation profile, limiting solar PV data for model training to a single year, although a longer validation period would be preferable. Third, the source for weather data is ERA5 which has limited spatial resolution, an issue that can be addressed once higher resolution datasets become available}\DIFaddend .

Future work is planned to extend the current analysis. First, climate projection data will be integrated with different energy scenarios, incorporating the addition of offshore wind, to better understand how climate change \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{might }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and offshore wind may }\DIFaddend affect RES droughts. Second, expanding the geographic domain of the study to include the rest of Europe\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, while also including the role of electricity interconnects between countries, }\DIFaddend would provide a more comprehensive understanding of RES droughts\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in an interconnected energy grid}\DIFdelend . This would require extensive verification across other European countries, making it a more complex but highly relevant challenge.
