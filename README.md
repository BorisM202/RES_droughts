## Sctructure

### Data

- `cap_solar_2017-2023.csv`: Contains information on solar PV farms in Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The location have been determined by the authors from manual search, the remaining columns can be found on: https://www.eirgrid.ie/grid/system-and-renewable-data-reports 
- `cap_wind_1990-2023.csv`: Contains information on wind farms in Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The location have been determined by the authors from manual search, the remaining columns can be found on: https://www.eirgrid.ie/grid/system-and-renewable-data-reports 
- `cf_combine_1979-2023.csv`: Contains capacity factor values from 1979-01-01 to 2023-12-31 for the three datasets compared in the study (ATL, C3S GRD, C3S NAT) for wind and solar PV. There are also a combination of wind and solar PV which is obtained by doing a weighted average of the the capacity factor for wind and solar PV and using the total installed capacity of the respective source. 
- `cf_solar_2018-2023.csv`: Contains solar PV capacity factor values from 2018-01-01 to 2023-12-31 for the three datasets compared in the study (ATL, C3S GRD, C3S NAT) for wind and solar PV.
