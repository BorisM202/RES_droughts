# Energy droughts are defined as periods of low production

The C3S-Energy dataset provides renewable energy capacity factor time series

Two C3S-Energy and one custom models are compared to assess RES droughts in Ireland
	
RES drought trends are explored by analysing 45 years of ERA5 weather data
	
Diverse energy mix reduces RES drought frequency, duration and extremes
	
Model selection is crucial in the accurate identification of RES droughts
